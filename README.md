### 2ยบ Exercise
This problem was to implement a simple bank account console system in C#, allowing account details to be displayed and deposits to be made.

#### Features: 
- Automatic generation of a random starting balance between -250 and 250.
- Deposit of amounts with automatic adjustment if the initial balance is negative, simulating an automatic debit to cover the use of special credit.
